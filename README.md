# stock_market_analysis
I have created a Project which can gather and Analyze Data of stocks through which one can take decisions whether to invest in a particular stock or not.
I have used multiple Python libraries like :
1) Pandas for creating Dataframes and Pandas DataReader to fetch the Data from Yahoo
   Finance for the past 1 year of data of particular stock.
2) Seaborn library for more detailed visualization of the multiple aspects of the stock.
# Features of my project
1) Fetches Data from Yahoo Finance (yfinance)
2) Calculates and plots 10-day, 20-day, and 50-day moving averages
3) Computes the Daily Returns of the stocks and visualizes them using line lots and histogram
4) Generates scatter plots, pair plots, and a heatmap to analyze correlations between stock returns
5) It simulates the future stock prices for Google using the Monte Carlo Method
6) It Calculates the 99% Value at Risk (VaR) based on simulated price distributions

# How to use the Project
You can easily use the Project for your use using the following steps
1) Clone the Repository using
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-analysis.git
   cd stock-analysis
2) Install the rewuired liraries
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn yfinance
3) Analyze the results using the graphs and other visualizations.
